# pydarsim
Python Radar and Tracking Simulator

My attempt at creating a radar simulation environment in python complete with detection simulation, spatial trajectory generation, and measurement filtering. I'm going to try to make it fairly modular so future radar, target, or filter models can be swapped in and out with ease.

I'll add some instructions on how to run the sim when I get it to runnable state.

Take a look at "Issues" for my comments on things I don't like, need to work on, future plans, etc.
